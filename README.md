# profanity_checker

A simple Python profanity checker program. 
- It makes use of Google's profanity API: http://www.wdylike.appspot.com/?q={content_from_text_file}
- Gives a simple response according to the response from the HTTP request. (From either 'true' or 'false')
- It's not handling any errors that might occur.

Remeber to check the path on the files. I'm using the relative path to the files, it shouldn't be a problem.
